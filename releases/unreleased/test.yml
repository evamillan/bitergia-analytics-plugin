title: Strict criteria for merge recommendations
category: added
author: Eva Millan <evamillan@bitergia.com>

notes: >
  The merge recommendations filter out invalid email adresses
  and names that don't have at least a first and last name 
  when looking for matches. To disable this behavior, set the
  `strict` parameter on `recommendMatches` or `unify` to `false`.
