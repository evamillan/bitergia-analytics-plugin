## Bitergia Analytics Plugin 0.7.0 - (2023-09-29)

**New features:**

 * Strict criteria for merge recommendations (#812)\
   The merge recommendations filter out invalid email adresses and names
   that don't have at least a first and last name  when looking for
   matches. To disable this behavior, set the `strict` parameter on
   `recommendMatches` or `unify` to `false`.
